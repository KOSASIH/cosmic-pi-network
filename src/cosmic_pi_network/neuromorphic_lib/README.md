# Neuromorphic Library
=====================

This is a super advanced high-tech neuromorphic library written in Rust. It provides a neural network module and a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) module.

# Getting Started
---------------

To use this library, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
1. [dependencies]
2. neuromorphic_lib = "0.1.0"
```

Then, import the library in your Rust file:

```rust
1. use neuromorphic_lib::NeuromorphicLib;
```

Create a new instance of the neuromorphic library:

```rust
1. let mut lib = NeuromorphicLib::new();
```

Train the neural network using STDP:

```rust
1. lib.train(&inputs, &targets);
```

Run the neural network:

```rust
1. let outputs = lib.run(&inputs);
```
